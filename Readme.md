# Nested Objects
We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

**Example Input1:**  
  object1 = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}  
  key1 = a/b/c  
*Output:*  
  value1 = d  
**Example Input2:**  
  object2 = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}  
  key2 = x/y/z  
*Output:*  
  value = a
